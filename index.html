        <h1>Being a Deliberate Communicator</h1>

        <p>I wanted to begin this semester by breaking the habit of treating my writing as something I simply “turn in,” and instead start treating it as something I <strong>build</strong>. My goals for this portfolio were to: (1) create a set of transferable skills for future assignments, (2) improve how I incorporate evidence and rhetorical strategies to persuade an audience, and (3) compose with greater confidence in formats outside of standard essays. This portfolio encompasses a semester of learning how to plan effectively, revise intentionally, and compose with the reader’s experience in mind.</p>

        <p>As noted in the curriculum, reflection is vital because it allows a writer to incorporate strategies into a communication toolbox that they own beyond the classroom. This concept of "ownership" was the main thread of my work this term.</p>

            <figcaption><strong>Fig. 1:</strong> A breakdown of my semester grades showing high consistency in foundational tasks like Learning Activities (95.06%) and Reflection (100%), while highlighting the Research Project (88.67%) as an area for continued growth.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>In reviewing my grades, the aspect that stands out most is consistency. My highest levels of performance include Learning Activities (95.06%), Drafting and Peer Review (92.42%), and Reflective Writing (100%). These scores demonstrate that I was diligent with smaller tasks, using them as scaffolding to help the larger projects grow.</p>

        <p>Conversely, the metrics also show that I am not yet where I want to be regarding depth and synthesis in the Research Project area (88.67%). However, I view this constructive gap positively; it indicates that I am still developing and honing specific skills. It represents where I am in this moment as a learner: figuring out how to take a raw argument and transform it into a designed, audience-focused piece.</p>

        <h2>My Process and Communication Habits</h2>

        <p>My writing process improved most when I began to <strong>think in steps rather than deadlines</strong>. Early in the semester, my process was to write quickly and ‘edit’ at the very end. I eventually learned that the best revisions happen when ideas and structure—not just sentences—are revisited. The regular cycles of learning exercises emphasized this: learn a specific skill, apply it to a draft, and then review the changes.</p>

        <p>I experienced this shift directly in my Major Projects. In my <strong>Rhetorical Analysis</strong>, I can trace growth from summary to analysis. In my draft, I moved beyond describing the text to analyzing how the writer used language to translate emotion to the audience. Specifically, I analyzed how the writer used vivid imagery—such as, "A striker towered over defenders"—to make the reader feel the intensity of the game.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="Screenshot 2025-12-15 214732.png" alt="Rhetorical Analysis Draft Excerpt">
            <figcaption><strong>Fig. 2:</strong> An excerpt from my Rhetorical Analysis draft. Note the transition from summary to analysis, where I explicitly connect the author's use of imagery ('towered over defenders') to the audience's sense of intensity.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>I focused on how he used comparison to heighten suspense and pointed back to individual players. I observed my own improvement in how I described these techniques; rather than listing them, I connected them to a specific audience response, such as excitement, suspense, or identification with the players.</p>

        <p>My <strong>Research Project</strong> challenged a different aspect of my process: organization and synthesis. In the draft excerpt below, the evidence illustrates how regular physical activity promotes better mental health. I utilized several levels of research, including cohort studies, trials, and meta-analyses. The major takeaway from this experience was realizing that simply <em>having</em> sources is not the same as <em>making an argument</em>.</p>

        <figure>

            <figcaption><strong>Fig. 3:</strong> A snapshot of my Research Project draft. This section demonstrates the synthesis of cohort studies and meta-analyses to build a structured argument about exercise and mental health.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The largest leap I made was learning to structure an argument <em>out of</em> my research, rather than just layering facts on top of one another. This is an area where my habits are still developing; research writing is not an instant process, and I need to budget more time to ensure the synthesis flows fluidly.</p>

        <h2>Improving Communication Ability and Design Development</h2>

        <p>One of the biggest skills I honed this semester was writing for an audience using design. My multimodal project is an infographic titled <strong>“The Morning Scroll Effect: How 10 Minutes on Your Phone Shapes Your Entire Day.”</strong> My audience consists of university students who begin and end their days scrolling. My goal was not to shame them, but to show them that the first 10–30 minutes of their day have a real basis in science.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="Screenshot 2025-12-15 214538.png" alt="Project Rationale and Design Reflection">
            <figcaption><strong>Fig. 4:</strong> My project rationale and initial design concepts. This draft outlines the rhetorical situation—addressing overwhelmed students with a calm, supportive tone rather than an overwhelming one.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>I selected an infographic format because it correlates well with how this community prefers to consume information. I structured the design to simulate the physical movement of scrolling—a vertical layout encouraging the reader to move down the page. I used icons, percentages, and short titles to break down difficult concepts (like blue light emission and cortisol levels) into digestible pieces.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="Screenshot 2025-12-05 230240.png" alt="Final Infographic Design">
            <figcaption><strong>Fig. 5:</strong> The final vertical infographic design. It uses a 'scrolling' layout, warm beige tones for a 'cozy' feel, and clear data visualization (80% vs 20%) to reduce cognitive load.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The primary lesson I learned through this multimodal experience is that persuasion is not merely a matter of words. It is also a matter of rhythm, hierarchy, and <strong>cognitive load</strong>: how easily a reader can comprehend an idea without becoming weary. I have altered my mentality; whereas I once queried only whether something was "correct," I now ask whether it can be easily comprehended and if the design invites the user to keep reading.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion and Next Steps</h2>

        <p>This semester has helped build faith in my abilities as a communicator because I now understand a workable process: plan ahead, write with intent, revise structure before style, and treat feedback as a resource rather than a commentary.</p>

        <p>As I look toward the spring semester, I have three specific goals. First, I plan to prioritize revising for <strong>cohesive flow</strong>, ensuring my writing showcases sound ideas connected by strong logic. Second, I aim to improve my synthesis skills so that my research reporting sounds less like a "laundry list" of sources and more like a guided narrative. Third, I aim to further hone my multimodal skills by piloting my designs with real people, as there is no better teacher of audience awareness than seeing how people react to your work in person.</p>
